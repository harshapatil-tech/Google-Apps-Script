    <p> Hi <?= name ?>,</p>
    <div style='font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; width=80%'>
      <p>Given the increasing instances of data breaches and cybersecurity issues, our customers have significantly 
        increased their investment in and vigilance toward data security and unauthorized access. Therefore, based on our 
        customers' recommendations, UpThink has implemented additional protocols to monitor the quality of work and prevent 
        unauthorized access to data. These protocols are executed through the following policies:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Employee productivity software (Teramind)
        <br>
        2. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy
      </p>
      <p>
        Teramind is a user activity, compliance, and insider threat prevention software. We are required to share Teramind reports with our customers to ensure that we are delivering our work in adherence to global standards. Teramind helps us record screen activity and track time for quality control for certain client centric roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BYOD policy outlines the do's and don'ts of using personal or official devices both within and outside the office.
      </p>

        Please read the attached policy document for details.
